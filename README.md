CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION 
This project focuses on customer segmentation using the Mall_Customers.csv dataset. The goal is to understand customer behavior by clustering them based on various features such as spending score, average income, and age. By applying clustering techniques, we identify distinct customer groups that can help businesses tailor their strategies for targeted marketing and improved customer experiences.
